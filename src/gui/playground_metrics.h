// The engine's mesh samples the design's exact ballooning law, so the rest
// pose IS the design shape, and every departure of the settled, loaded wing
// from it is a structural signal: fabric going slack, a nose denting
// inward, a section washing out, a line row shedding load. Everything here

// sits above the clean working band (-2..+14 deg) and below the collapse
// states, so a flag means "off the healthy band", not "the model's normal

// Leading-edge dent, as a fraction of the rib's rest chord, floored at a

// sections — genuinely floppy on real wings, standing at ~100 mm of nose
// travel while perfectly healthy — cannot drive a wing-level flag. A
// healthy loaded wing stands at 2-5% of chord here (the unloaded
