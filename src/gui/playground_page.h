// The Playground tab: an instrumented wind tunnel for shape fidelity (see
// docs/legacy/leparagliding/playground-shape-analysis.md). The engine's companion mesh
// (lep-sim.json — coarse welded skin quads sampled from the exact
// ballooning law, rib loops, labelled suspension lines) is assembled into
// a softwing XPBD soft body, loaded by the tunnel's pressure field plus an
// optional wing-level flight load, and measured against its own rest pose
// — which IS the design shape. The instruments (the colour-by heatmaps,
// the live shape HUD, the grab tool, the Analyse α-sweep) report where
// the loaded wing departs from it: fabric going slack, a row unloading, a
// nose denting. The claim is relative and structural, never absolute
// aerodynamics. Free flight survives as an experimental toy mode.
